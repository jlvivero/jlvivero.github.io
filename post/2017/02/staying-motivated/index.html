I found myself having a hard time focusing and improving further, I knew I had a lot of time in my hands but to be honest, I was a little bit burnt out.  </p>
<p>I studied a lot in very little time for my google interview, and while It did not yield the best results, it took a toll on me. If I could have distributed my time more evenly (maybe not try to cram a lot of knowledge in 1 month) would have been way better.  </p>
<p>So I decided to take a break, for the first time in a while, no side projects, no tinkering no nothing for my whole winter break. I just relaxed, played games and had fun with friends. It was nice to be honest and <strong>I would recommend everyone to take breaks like that from time to time</strong>, but once that break was over I needed to stay motivated.  </p>
<p>I had a problem with that, because I didn&#39;t have any real deadlines, since it is my last semester in college, there&#39;s not many exciting classes like last semester&#39;s compilers class to keep me motivated. <em>(our AI class is really sub par and the only class that&#39;s worth anything is distributed systems)</em>  </p>
<p>So the first 2 weeks of classes I had a hard time doing much, but that&#39;s fine, school isn&#39;t my problem right now, school is easy. The problem was, getting motivation to study, at a decent pace for job interviews in the future. It&#39;s hard to start before you even get the interviews, but at the same time, as I learnt in my google application experience, you&#39;re already too late to learn everything if you already have a date.  </p>
<p><strong>So how did I fix this problem?</strong> It was something that I never realized I needed so much until I got a message from a friend. <strong>Co-working</strong>, he had a project due soon from work but he was having a hard time getting the last part of the project done. So he messaged me to get together and work, I wasn&#39;t going to help him on his project, I was gonna work on whatever I wanted or needed. So I worked on learning a new language, maybe do homework, or even just practice algorithms, while he worked on his project. The interesting thing about this, was that If either of us had a problem, we could talk it through, even if I didn&#39;t know anything about the project, I had at least some decent input about how I would approach a problem in general. Even if I was completely off the mark, it helped him see things from a different perspective.     </p>
<p>For me the effects were different, of course it helped that he is a more experienced developer, so I can ask any question and he&#39;ll probably have a decent answer. It was the fact that I was working with a peer that I respected, it pushed me into working and getting motivated to learn more. This is very important for me, because <strong>it made me realize how important it is to be challenged by your peers to not be complacent.</strong></p>
<p>From now on, I will always strive to be surrounded by peers that are as smart or smarter than me; and are more hardworking than me. That way, I can keep my motivation going by striving to be like them or better.</p>
