<p>Now someone asked what&#39;s a good advice on how to learn to program when you have ADHD. When I saw the tweet I got excited and was very happy to give the advice, but I realized that there was no way to put it into one tweet <em>(yes even with the new tweet length)</em>. So I promised to make a separate post about it and here I am.</p>
<p>So to give proper advice I want to give a little bit of background on how I learnt programming. If you&#39;re not interested in my story you can skip this part, just scroll down.</p>
<h2 id="my-story">My story</h2>
<p>It all began when I decided to not study civil engineer (after 3 years, yeah...) and I decided to look for what I really enjoyed in life.<br>To be honest those were really hard times for me, I was going through a lot, but I had good people next to me that supported me.<br>I spent 6 months just looking for what I liked and finally came to the conclusion that I wanted to learn programming (I already knew the basics from highschool but in reality it was almost nothing).
So I took it upon myself to learn what I needed, and boy was it a mess, I had no idea what to learn or how. </p>
<p>I had no idea where to start and knowing me, I knew I would just get overwhelmed and quit.<br>I started learning python by myself, but I could not get through with it alone. I decided I needed to go to college, I wasn&#39;t too excited about it, but I knew that if I didn&#39;t have the proper structure to learn I wouldn&#39;t be able to succeed.</p>
<p>I talked it over with my family and my girlfriend at the time and they supported me completely, so I started my new adventure in computer science, and the learning structure helped me a lot.<br>Then... not so much. After I learnt the basics of computer science, honestly, school became boring. It was more interesting to learn on my own. I knew enough to defend myself and I knew what I wanted to learn and in what order now, so things started becoming more natural to me.</p>
<p>And after that point school wasn&#39;t THAT interesting, but it doesn&#39;t mean it was useless. In the end I do wish I had known about so many online resources like Udacity and such, or talked to someone that went through a similar experience as I did to help me compile a list of material (in a specific order) to learn on my own. Regardless school was a good substitute for that to be honest and I don&#39;t regret it.</p>
<h2 id="actual-advice">Actual Advice</h2>
<p>Now, the most important actual advice I can give is, find structure. Let&#39;s be honest, if you have ADHD like me, you know we <strong>SUCK</strong> at prioritizing things correctly half the time and we will jump from thing to thing if we don&#39;t have a previous structure to guide us. I know that if you don&#39;t know anything about computer science things can be very overwhelming; but fear not, I have the solution.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite simple, I&#39;ll take what school gave me and give you a list of topics you should research in order to learn, <em>yay</em>. Now following the order or not is up to you, and you can do this in many different ways. My list/advice is just that, advice, it&#39;ll help you find some structure in your learning and that&#39;s what matters.</p>
<p>All you have to do is stick to it, or stick to your alternative method, the point is stick to wtv you plan. <em>(it&#39;s so hard I know there&#39;s so many cool things out there)</em></p>
<p>Now we&#39;ll start with the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The basics of programming</strong>. I recommend you learn this through Udacity, a great and <strong>Free</strong> resource that has the very thing we talked about: <em>structure</em> just log in and get right to it:<br><a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101">https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101</a> In case the link doesn&#39;t work the course is called intro to computer science, it teaches the basics of programming using python.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The google way</strong>: this is a very good guide to development that google curated for anyone to use, it&#39;s really good, and I actually used it myself for a bit. <a href="https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/">https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/</a> By the time I used it I already knew most of these stuff so I kinda just used it for certain stuff like android developing. It&#39;s still very good and a very nice alternative. This guide goes way further than the basics, so you can kinda just follow this along for almost your whole learning experience. (If you&#39;re using this, use the recommended order, because that&#39;s the point, make use of the structure given to you by google).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, let&#39;s move on to the most important things you can learn about programming <strong>Data structures and algorithms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is basically what programming is all about, and the best resource I can think of is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/</a><br> Again make use of the structure, it&#39;s in order, just follow the order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright we&#39;re all set in terms of information for now right?, well it&#39;s time for your first project. Whatever it is you want to make, do it, it&#39;s fine, but keep it simple and follow a tutorial.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>want to make a game? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwuPiaFU37w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwuPiaFU37w</a> learn unity and C# (or any game engine you want, just follow along)</p>
</li>
<li><p>want to make a webpage? <a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/your-first-node-js-http-server/">https://blog.risingstack.com/your-first-node-js-http-server/</a> build your first http server with nodejs, then start learning http/css javascript </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how im being a little bit more free in what you learn and how to obtain the resources? It&#39;s because you&#39;re getting to the point where you are almost ready to be set free, you have the basics down and you are following along tutorials to make projects from scratch.</p>
<p>Next you <strong>need</strong> to learn git, if you learnt it earlier good, if not, stop everything you are doing and go learn git right now. There are a lot of tutorials available, just go do it.</p>
<p>Now the last scary part, do whatever you just did above, but from actual scratch, make a new web app, make a new game, even if it&#39;s silly, do it from scratch, do it yourself. Don&#39;t worry, google and stack overflow will guide you a lot anyways.</p>
<p>Wow we&#39;re almost done with this well structured but very free-like <em>(we people with ADHD love our freedom)</em> learning list. You are ready to make applications, but I believe you should learn how things work at a lower level, so at this point I recommend you learn a little bit about <strong>OS and compilers.</strong></p>
<p>Ironically for my OS class I made a video that teaches what you need to learn to make your own kernel (very basic it&#39;s meant to be to learn the concepts and understand it a little bit better not for you to be able to actually make your own Operating System):<br><a href="https://youtu.be/fRuBtt6WC1U">https://youtu.be/fRuBtt6WC1U</a> Hope it&#39;s useful.</p>
<p>And last but not least, Compilers, I do not have a lot of resources for this to be honest so I&#39;m going to let you figure that one out for yourself. </p>
<h2 id="what-other-advice-can-you-give-me-">What other advice can you give me?</h2>
<p>Well the truth is that as someone with ADHD there are bad days and good days, some days you can&#39;t concentrate on learning anything new and some days you can&#39;t stop learning. Accept it, it&#39;s just the way we work.<br>We have an <em>advantage</em> here, Computer Science is all about <em>improving and learning constantly</em> and we are by our very nature very curious people. Once you get over the first hurdle you&#39;ll realize that if you truly enjoy programming you won&#39;t stop wanting to learn new things and that will always give you an edge over the rest.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say is, <strong>have fun</strong>, look for things you are passionate about and do them. It&#39;ll be great, make projects and do things. I cannot stress this enough DO THINGS, I know I know, we suck at finishing things, but <strong>believe me</strong> even if you have incomplete projects on github, it&#39;s way better than nothing, just make sure you work on improving yourself.</p>
<p>Finally shutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/HowtoADHD">@HowtoADHD</a> for giving us so many resources to make ADHD work in our favor instead of against us.</p>
