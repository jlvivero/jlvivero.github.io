<p>Today I&#39;m in North Carolina, I&#39;m about to start my first job after college as a computer scientist, and I want to talk  about my experience traveling and moving with only a couple thousand dollars to my name and basically nothing else.</p>
<h2 id="not-as-easy">Not as easy</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the first problem I encountered when moving, it&#39;s something that a lot of people will <strong>NOT</strong> identify with because it&#39;s really rare this day and age and that is: I have no credit score.   </p>
<p>Yep you heard me, I have none, it&#39;s not a bad credit score and it&#39;s not a great credit score, it just doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>Now a lot of people told me: <em>&quot;hey having no credit score is better than having  a bad one&quot;</em> and well that&#39;s true, but that&#39;s still not helpful, when moving to a different state you are on your own. I traveled all the way from California (I&#39;m from cali if you didn&#39;t know already) to North Carolina, which means I only know a couple of people here and have no backup from my family or close friends.</p>
<p>That means that If something goes wrong the money I have in my bank is basically all I have, and that&#39;s the problem with not having credit, I cannot pay for rent/food/amenities/ if I don&#39;t well use that money on my bank account.</p>
<p>Which means I have to be extra careful until I start work (in two days) and until I have enough money on the bank saved up for emergencies.</p>
<p>So for those people that haven&#39;t built up a credit score, this is my recomendation, build one, it&#39;s not a big deal and you don&#39;t have to be in &quot;debt&quot; that&#39;s something I thought I had to do to build a credit score, but there are simpler ways to build it.   </p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>I won&#39;t get into details because this blog is not about my finances so let&#39;s move on to the nice things about North Carolina. </p>
<p>First of the snow, damn does snow look so pretty on cities; It really makes everything look cleaner <em>(until it starts melting)</em>. As someone from cali, I had no idea how nice snow was <em>(but had no idea how cold it got either ;_;)</em> </p>
<p>The next thing that&#39;s amazing is getting to meet my longtime friends from North Carolina, I&#39;m so happy to finally meet them in person after playing games together for so long. </p>
<p>Next my apartment complex, it&#39;s a little pricy for the small apartment I got but it has a lot of amenities that would make my stay impossible had they&#39;ve not been there because of my situation.  </p>
<p>they have a very beautiful common area, with free wifi and coffee, a gym and a pool <em>(It&#39;s snowing so no  pool available right now)</em>; but the most important thing about this apartments is that the area looks wholesome and safe, and that takes a weight off me when going to work etc. </p>
<p>It&#39;s also close to one of my two work locations so that&#39;s great, I will have google fiber which I&#39;m very excited about, unfortunately it won&#39;t be installed until the 21. So that&#39;s two weeks without internet <em>(which is why I am so grateful for the free wifi in the common area of my apartment complex)</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ll finish this blog saying that it has definitely been an adventure, learning to live by yourself is hard when it&#39;s your first time, and even harder when you have a limited budget until your first paycheck. You can&#39;t just buy everything you know you need, you have to only buy key things. I am very grateful for my friends here in NC that have made my stay easier, and helped me get everything I need from giving me free stuff to driving me around so I can buy the things I need. </p>
<p>Now that I have a steady job, I think I&#39;ll start writing a little bit more about open source software and games, since that&#39;s what I plan on working on my free time; who knows maybe I&#39;ll even show off a game I make sometime soon.</p>
